Dear Editors,

we are sending our study trying to address the controversial question whether and how opening and/or closing schools influenced the course of Covid pandemic. Having data including exact ages, we were able to distinguish infections of school children. Moreover, due to several occasions when part of the school grades have been opened while the rest has been closed, we were able to perform comparisons independent on most of the potential additional influences. We hope you find our work interesting.
